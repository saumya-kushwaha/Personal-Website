        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Anish. I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at Syracuse University.
        </p>
        <p>
            A fascination for Science & Technology and keen interest in the ever-growing world of technology motivated me to take up engineering. I discovered my passion for electronics and computers quite early in life. Of all the subjects I studied, Embedded Systems and Programming attracted me like no other! Consequently, in my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication at PES Institute of Technology, I completed four major and two minor projects along with publishing an IEEE research paper in the domain.

        <h3>Statement of Interest</h3>
        <p>
            I truly believe in expanding my mental horizons and detailed understanding of latest tools and technologies adopted by engineering, with the time. I want to learn technical, managerial as well as behavioral aspects of the field to work in higher positions. I strongly feel that master’s program will inculcate a strong quality assurance and testing component in my knowledge, so as to raise the level of excellence in my work. I know that an academic experience is must to have component for growth in global field of software engineering, as well as to make a mark in professional career. As a Software Engineer, on a day-to-day basis, I am inspired by translating ideas into a fragment of reality and have been influenced by the virtue of programming in a big way. Since the time I was introduced to this vast world of Computer Science, I have been working on various technologies like C#, C++, PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, Web Technologies, Internet Of Things, and likewise.
        </p>
        <p>
            My aspiration is to be a full stack software developer and I am looking forward to seeking a platform for the same.

        <h3>Career Preference</h3>
        <p>
            As Software engineering encompasses the knowledge from different fields like computer engineering, computer science, mathematics, testing methodologies, quality management, project management etc. I came to a conclusion that career in software engineering can be very rewarding as there is demand for software engineers across the industries. Given my profound interest in programming and software development, I visualize my future as a system software developer working in top MNCs like Apple and Intel. I would like to work on exciting projects such as Autonomous driving systems or Mitigating and Degradation of Congested Sensor Networks. After gaining around ten years of experience, I would definitely grow into the role of a product manager in one of the above firms.
